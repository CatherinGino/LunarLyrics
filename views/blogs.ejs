                    <p>What we often refuse to realize is that holding on to the past - <br>
                        no matter what it was or how awful it was - is ONLY HURTING
                        US.<br><br> "They" really don't care. <br> Usually, "they" are not even aware. <br>
                        We are only hurting ourselves by refusing to live in this moment
                        to the fullest. <br> - You can Heal your Life.<br><br>
                        <b>I am not aware most of the time that it's all in my head and I am the one who is hurting

                    <p>‚ÄúLast year, I rested. This year, I rise.‚Äù<br><br>
                        I learnt a lot in the past year ~ like so much...<br>
                        I have no idea where to start
                        -love-friendship-happiness-sorrow-excitement-fear-clarity-confusion-calmness-and finally
                        peace and finding myself again after the war is over.<br>
                        It may seem like I am overreacting to you but I felt it all - I lived it.<br>
                        but right now, In this moment I love it all - I love everything that I felt, every single
                        emotions makes me complete and makes me uniquely me.<br><br>
                        It's okay if I am a bit late, my timing is just different from the rest and I bloom üåπ when it's
                        the right time for me~<br><br>
                        with LOVE~ @13/07/2025</p>
