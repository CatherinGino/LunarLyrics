                        There is always hope in everything....<br>
                        There is always love around us ~ we just have to look<br><br>
                        Today I am going to talk about something that doesn't exist: PERFECTION<br><br>                       
                        Don't be so shocked and disagree with me just yet, something as soo beautiful as a diamond is also imperfect.
                        There is no two diamonds that looks exactly the same and their imperfections makes them
                        authentically themselves.<br><br>
                        We live in a society where people criticize someone who stands out of the croud and are
                        different but the people who live their truly authentic selves are the ones with the most
                        fulfilled life ever.<br>
                        When you start to change, the ones around you change too and the one who don't change - they are
                        the type of people who you don't want in your life. <br>
                        Move on... Atleast you have yourself, don't lose yourself chasing someone else.<br>
                        Being imperfect means being authentic and being authentic is the most beautiful thing ever.<br><br>

                        I just found the ultimate answer to all of mankind's problems ... <br>
                        In one year of college I have changed a lot - a tonnn. I found problems and then I realized
                        myself being stuck but maybe it was all for the good, cuz I found myself and the ultimate
                        solution.<br>
                        This might be a bit hard to digest but I found the answer in a <span
                            style="text-decoration: underline;">Book</span> - <br>You know I love books but I just
                        changed the genre I read from romantic novels to personality development.<br>
                        Okay, now let's not wait any more longer and find the ultimate solution...
                    </p>
                    <p class="full-text" style="display: none;">
                        The ultimate answer is <span style="color: palevioletred;"><em>LOVE</em></span>. Don't think it
                        is just
                        for fun - I am serious. The change starts from the MIND - If you change your thoughts, you
                        change your attitute which changes your actions and then your habits changes and if you have
                        read
                        "ATOMIC HABITS" before you will know the importance of habits - it changes your lifestyle that
                        has the power to change your LIFE.<br><br>
                        And it all starts with LOVING the SELF... You can't love someone else if you can't even LOVE
                        YOURSELF.
