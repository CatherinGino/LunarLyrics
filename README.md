# 🌙 LunarLyrics

Welcome to **LunarLyrics**,  
my personal sanctuary of emotions, thoughts, music, healing, and self-discovery — all wrapped in code.  
This isn't just a blog — it's a living part of me. It's my first real full-stack project (both frontend + backend)  
and I poured my soul into every word, style, and pixel.  
I hope when you read it, you feel what I felt: growth, love, heartbreak, light, and rebirth.

## 💡 Why I Built This

During my first year of college, I went through a lot of personal shifts.  
From romantic novels to self-discovery books like **You Can Heal Your Life**, my journey redefined how I saw myself and the world.  
I built LunarLyrics as a tribute to that growth. A digital journal — for myself and others like me who are still figuring things out, one line of code and lyric at a time.
